This is my project for my first time using SQL and DBeaver. I did a Maven project that had you create a database where you can explore what projects you have and add to the database as well as delete projects from the database. 
I enjoyed making this project because it was something new and challenging. There was a lot of back and forth between the different applications and navigating was at times challenging but started to make sense the more I advanced. 
I liked being able to make the different options to choose from and also creating the database for the project.
